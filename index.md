## Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Energy Exploration

This is an ongoing project to centralize, standardize, and explore publicly available data about nuclear weapons testing and nuclear power reactors. Much of the existing data is distributed broadly among a number of sources, and some of it (especially where nuclear testing is concerned, and even moreso for thermonuclear testing) is fragmented or incomplete. If you notice something incorrect or missing, feel free to contact me or submit an issue and I'll try to resolve it as soon as I can.
